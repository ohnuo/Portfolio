        This is a drawing that Nuo made by following Yulia's written description of an object that she lost.

        The original description: Color: blue. Gradient from top to bottom. From deep blue to blue. With my name on it in the left bottom corner. (Yulia Ivanova) Chase logo upper right corner Ending number: ******2845

      </p>

      <p>
     My partner's description is generally clear. Since the object is relatively common in daily life, it was easy to picture the whole thing and the details, although the texts didn't include details like the exact colors of the card and the chase logo, and the scale of the logo from the text.

     When depicting the object in code, I found the most difficult part to be creating the gradient colors. I found the code for creating gradient colors online, but it will fill the entire canvas. I made some alterations to the code so that the gradient color is only on the shape of the card. But I didn't figure out how to let the colors stay perfectly match the rounded edge of the card.
