          <p>
            My experimental clock is based on portraiting the change in the perception of time when someone is waiting. The viewer is in the role of a person whose partner is trying to break up with the person. A viewer may click the mouse and respond to the incoming message as soon as possible, but it is much longer to wait for the new message. In reality, while we are waiting anxiously for a response that we are eager to know, time might seem slower than it actually is. 
          </p>

         <h1>
          Design Process
         </h1>

          <p>
          I drew three sketches in the beginning. The first one is the p5 sketch here. The second portrait's legs move quicker or slower based on the conditions of the weather in the background. The third one is a canvas split in half. When people click the mouse, coffee beans keep dropping fast on the left side, while the coffee rises very slowly in the glass on the right side. I choose the first one because I think waiting is the most noticeable change in my perception of time, and it happens commonly in daily life. 

          When making the p5 sketch, I mainly incorporated "set Timeout()" to design the time and pace for the incoming message and used "let" combined with two "if()" to arrange when the viewer may respond to the messages.
