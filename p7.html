           Description
         </h1>

         <p>
          For my data portrait, I tracked my smoking habit for 4 days. Each time I smoked, I observed my mood, whether I was alone or with other people, and what I was doing. 
          The large brown squares represent each time that I smoke.
          The colors of the smaller squares present my mood at that time:
          Gray -- tired  Blue -- sad  White -- nothing  Yellow -- cheerful  Purple -- bored
          The motion of the black dot inside the square presents what was I doing at that time: a moving dot means I was talking; a still dot means I was watching something (phone, computer, book, etc.); no dot shows that I was not doing any other thing. 
          The red dot represents that I was with other people when smoking. 
          </p>

          <h1>
          Process 
        </h1>

         <p>
          First, I assigned symbols to each variable of my data. I hope them to be not so literal, but still easy to read. I used the for loop to draw all the basic shapes. Then I used the array to call the colors. 
          </p>

          <h1>
          Reflection
        </h1>


          <p>
          It was a bit difficult for me when assigning different colors to the small rectangles. I learned to use one conditioned variable to connect the coordinate of the small rectangles and the sequence of calling different colors, so they were drawn together at the same time. 
          Overall I enjoyed the process. I found that I was more prone to smoke when I felt tired. I was usually with other people and watching something when I felt cheerful. I think the project provides me with a new way to see data.
